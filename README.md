# Hotel_Booking_Cancellation_Project
The Hotel Booking Cancellation Project focuses on analyzing and modeling booking cancellation patterns in the hospitality industry. It combines data exploration, feature engineering, and predictive modeling to understand what drives cancellations and to help hotels reduce revenue loss. The project includes exploratory data analysis, various machine learning models, and practical business recommendations.It also provides guidance on setting up and using the analysis with tools like Python.

# Overview
The Hotel Booking Cancellation Project aims to analyze patterns in hotel booking cancellations. By leveraging historical booking data, the project seeks to identify key factors that drive cancellations and build predictive models to help reduce revenue loss.

# Business Problem
The main business problem is the financial impact of booking cancellations, which lead to lost revenue and increased operational costs. The project aims to reduce these losses by predicting which bookings are likely to be canceled.

# Assumptions
Historical booking data accurately reflects future trends.

Features like lead time, booking channel, and cancellation policy are significant predictors.

# Research Questions
What are the main factors influencing booking cancellations?

Can we predict cancellations accurately based on historical data?

# Hypotheses
Longer lead times increase the likelihood of cancellations.

Non-refundable bookings have a lower cancellation rate compared to refundable ones.

# Key Insights
Lead time, booking channel, and cancellation policy are strong predictors of cancellations.

Certain customer demographics and booking conditions significantly influence cancellation rates.

# Conclusions
The project demonstrates that by understanding the factors that drive cancellations, hotels can implement targeted strategies to minimize revenue loss. Predictive modeling helps in proactive decision-making and improves overall booking management.
